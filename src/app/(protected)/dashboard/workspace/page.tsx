          This project is dedicated to Lilly, my late kitten, who was always by
          my side. No matter the hour, she would find me — jumping through my
          window at night, meowing for attention, and keeping me company through
          every moment. Her loyalty, warmth, and playful energy kept me going
          and made each day a little brighter. When she fell ill with a sudden
          viral fever, I did everything I could to save her, but it wasn’t
          enough. Losing her left a quiet space in my life that I didn’t know
          how to fill. I decided to channel that energy into diving deeper into
          the world of full-stack development and DevOps, pushing myself to
          design, build, and launch this application. These are its first baby
          steps — created to be reliable, ever-present, and a companion in your
          day-to-day journey, just as Lilly was in mine.
